# `generate_group_orders.py`

`Desc:` generates customer order intentions, processes them into actual customer orders, then organises them into groups. 

This script üìù simulates the process of customers üë®‚Äçüíª selecting food üçΩÔ∏è and drink üç∑ based on the predefined probabilities üé≤ in the config file ‚öôÔ∏è.

## Overview

1. **Generates _CUSTOMER ORDER INTENTIONS_**: based on probability distributions loaded from a [configuration file](sim_config.json).
2. **Materialises  _INTENTIONS_ into individual _CUSTOMER ORDERS_**: selects items from a provided menu of items (such as starters, mains, drinks, etc.).
3. **Groups together _CUSTOMER ORDERS_**: organises orders into groups based on certain criteria (e.g., customers without starters are grouped together, customers with the same sharing main item are grouped together).
4. **Adds _WINE_ to satisfy a _GROUP's_ wine order INTENTION**: both regular and dessert wine
5. **Adds _SIDES_ and _EXTRAS_ to _GROUP ORDERS_**: based on choice of main and probability set in the [configuration file](sim_config.json).

### `generate_customer_order_intention()`

Generates a random customer order intention based on the probabilities specified in the `sim_config.json` configuration file.

**Output**: `customer_order_intention_dict: {}`

- A dictionary representing a single customer's order intention, including:
  - Number of alcoholic drinks (`n_alc_drinks`)
  - Number of wine servings (`n_wine_servings`)
